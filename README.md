{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tally": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/tally-mcp-server/start-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "TALLY_API_KEY": "tally_your_actual_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Command not found" error**
   - Verify Node.js installation: `node --version`
   - Check the absolute path in your Claude config
   - Ensure the `start-server.js` file exists and is executable

2. **"Authentication failed" error**
   - Double-check your API key in `.env` or Claude config
   - Ensure API key starts with `tally_`
   - Verify your [Tally](https://lttlmg.ht/tally) account has API access

3. **Tools not appearing in Claude**
   - Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit and reopen)
   - Check JSON syntax in config file (use a JSON validator)
   - Verify file paths are absolute, not relative
   - Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

4. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run `npm install` in the project directory
   - Ensure `npm run build` completed successfully
   - Check that the `build/` directory exists

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Test the server starts without errors
npm start

# Or use the start script directly
node start-server.js

# Test with a simple API call (requires API key in .env)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TALLY_API_KEY" https://api.tally.so/forms
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=true NODE_ENV=development node start-server.js
```
